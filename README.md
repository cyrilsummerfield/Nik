# Nik ‚Äî A Voice‚ÄëActivated AI Assistant

This is an AI assistant that I made (with a little help from ChatGPT üòâ.) It allows you to talk to various GenAI models verbally, as well as enables the AI to open websites in Chrome. You can be direct with it, such as "Open Gmail," or you can be less precise, such as "Open a website with baseball stats." It is certainly not perfect, for you have to say your command within 2 seconds, and it can be slow to respond to commands and questions. I also have not tested it on any systems besides Raspbian (a Unix build for Raspberry Pis), so it might not work well on other machines. Below I have listed the instructions to set it up on your computer.

- Examples:

  - `Nick, open a website with baseball stats`
  - `Nick, what‚Äôs the capital of Australia?`
- If Nik can‚Äôt find the requested URL it will tell you so.
